# Broken App Issues

- POST request responds with an empty object for each developer object that is spposed to be returned
- Some variables are given one letter names (undescriptive)
- app.listen() only contains 3000, doesn't include any kind of message to indicate the server has started and on which port
- async/await not implementented properly
- Lack of refactoring - I went ahead and created a separate file for the server & routes
